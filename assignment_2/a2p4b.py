    You need to implement this method.

    You are certainly allowed to define any subroutines you want
    above this method in this file.

    We will test with inputs that match the spec only --- G will
    be a non-empty graph, i.e., at least one vertex, and a, b will
    be distinct valid vertices in G --- so that means G will have at
    least 2 vertices. Of course within those constraints, we could test
    for corner cases. E.g., a graph of no edges, e.g., G = [[],[],[]]
